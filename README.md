# Stock-Prediction-LSTM
Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains a Python script that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock price data and makes predictions based on past trends.

Features
Utilizes LSTM neural networks for time series forecasting.
Preprocesses data using pandas and scales features with sklearn.
Visualizes training progress and prediction results using matplotlib.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
You can install these packages using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
Make sure you have the dataset (NSE-Tata.csv) in the root directory of the cloned repository.

Usage
Run the script to train the model and visualize the predictions:

python main.py
The script will automatically preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and plot the actual vs predicted stock prices.
