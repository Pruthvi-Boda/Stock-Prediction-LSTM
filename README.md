# Stock-Prediction-LSTM
Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains a Python script that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock price data and makes predictions based on past trends.

# Features
- Utilizes LSTM neural networks for time series forecasting.
- Preprocesses data using pandas and scales features with sklearn.
- Visualizes training progress and prediction results using matplotlib.
- Getting Started
- Prerequisites

# Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

# Dataset:

I have taken data from finance.yahoo.com and chose TATA stocks as my dataset. 

# Usage

Run the script to train the model and visualize the predictions:

Here, we are using Sequential, LSTM, Dropout and Dense layers to train the model. Visualizations are at the end where we visualise actual vs predicted values.
